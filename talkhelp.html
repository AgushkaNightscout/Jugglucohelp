<p>On some phones the Android settings for text-to-speech have to be
changed for it to work. Sometimes the data of a language has to be
installed or the configuration changed. On Samsung phones &quot;<i>Google
text-to-speech</i>&quot; has to be set instead of &quot;<i>Samsung
text-to-speech engine</i>&quot; in order to choice from different
voices. These options can be found by searching for <i>text-to-speech</i>
in Android settings or going to <i>Language and input
(-&gt;Advanced)-&gt;Text-to-Speech</i>. Here you can select &quot;<i>Speech
Services by Google</i>&quot; and install voice data. In other phones
it is under <i>System settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Vision-&gt;Text-to-Speech
settings</i>.</p>
